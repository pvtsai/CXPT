# Business Context

Microsoft is planning to create a new movie studio and is interested in better understanding the film industry.
We were tasked with providing conducting an analysis investigating the types of films currently performing best at the box office. Our ultimate goal was to provide a recommendations on the director to hire, the genre of movie to produce, and the month to release the film in. 

## Key Questions
1. Which movie genres generate the highest multiples on money?
1. Which directors generate the highest grossing films?
1. Which season should we release our movie in?

# Data

We utilized several datasets to develop our analyses including movie-related data from:

* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org

# The Deliverables

There are three required deliverables for this project:

1. A well documented **Jupyter Notebook** containing any code you've written for this project and comments explaining it.
1. An organized **README.md** file in the GitHub repository that describes the contents of the repository. This file should be the source of information for navigating through the repository.
1. A Github repository containing all of the above files and any additional files worth includding
1. [OPTIONAL] A short **slide deck** (delivered as a PDF export) giving a high-level overview of your methodology and recommendations for non-technical stakeholders. If you do this, make sure to also add and commit this pdf of your non-technical presentation to your repository with a file name of presentation.pdf.

### Jupyter Notebook Must-Haves

For this project, your Jupyter Notebook should meet the following specifications:

#### Organization/Code Cleanliness

* The notebook should be well organized, easy to follow,  and code should be commented where appropriate.  
    * Level Up: The notebook contains well-formatted, professional looking markdown cells explaining any substantial code.  All functions have [docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) that act as professional-quality documentation
* The notebook is written for technical audiences with a way to both understand your approach and reproduce your results. The target audience for this deliverable is other data scientists looking to validate your findings.

#### Visualizations & EDA

* Your project contains at least 4 meaningful data visualizations, with corresponding interpretations. All visualizations are well labeled with axes labels, a title, and a legend (when appropriate)  
* You pose at least 3 meaningful questions and answer them through EDA.  These questions should be well labeled and easy to identify inside the notebook.
    * **Level Up**: Each question is clearly answered with a visualization that makes the answer easy to understand.   
* Your notebook should contain 1 - 2 paragraphs briefly explaining your approach to this project.

## Grading Rubric

This rubric is garbage, but if you'd like something to reference, use the top half of  [this](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1/blob/master/module1_project_rubric.pdf).  Reminder: this is not actually being graded.

## Summary

The end of module projects are a critical part of the program. They give you a chance to both bring together all the skills you've learned into realistic projects.

The projects are serious and important. They are not graded, but feedback will be given. Take the project seriously, put the time in, ask for help from your peers or instructors early and often if you need it, and treat the review as a job interview and you'll do great. We're rooting for you to succeed and we're only going to ask you to take a review again if we believe that you need to. We'll also provide open and honest feedback so you can improve as quickly and efficiently as possible.
